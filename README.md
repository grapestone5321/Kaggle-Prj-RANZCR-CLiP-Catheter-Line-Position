## Goal
In this competition, youâ€™ll detect the presence and position of catheters and lines on chest x-rays. 

Use machine learning to train and test your model on 40,000 images to categorize a tube that is poorly placed.

The dataset has been labelled with a set of definitions to ensure consistency with labelling. 

The normal category includes lines that were appropriately positioned and did not require repositioning. 

The borderline category includes lines that would ideally require some repositioning but would in most cases still function adequately in their current position. 

The abnormal category included lines that required immediate repositioning.
